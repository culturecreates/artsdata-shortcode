# Wordpress shortcodes for Artsdata

This is a Wordpress plugin that adds shortcodes for retrieving and displaying data from Artsdata and Wikidata in a WordPress site. This plugin is currently only used to power the CAPACOA LIVE directory, but it could be used to power other kinds of directories on WordPress websites.

The 3 shortcodes are:
* [artsdata_orgs] => lists organization names from Artsdata located in a source graph
* [artsdata_id] => displays details of a specific entity using ranked graphs from Artsdata
* [artsdata_admin] => displays buttons for admin to reload CAPACOA database or reload data from Wikidata (https://capacoa.ca/en/artsdata-admin/)
